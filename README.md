# Age and Gender Detection Using MediaPipe

This project is a **lightweight and efficient age and gender detection system** built using **MediaPipe**, a highly optimized cross-platform library developed by Google. It leverages **MediaPipe's real-time processing capabilities** to deliver accurate predictions for both age and gender detection. The system has been designed with an emphasis on speed, accuracy, and ease of deployment, making it suitable for real-time applications on various devices.

## 🧠 Models Used in the Project

### 1. Age Detection Model
- The age detection model predicts the approximate age of a person based on facial features.
- It uses a deep learning-based approach, fine-tuned for regression tasks, to estimate age as a continuous value.
- The model is lightweight and optimized for real-time processing, ensuring minimal lag while maintaining prediction accuracy.
- It can detect ages across a wide range, from children to elderly individuals, making it versatile for various use cases.

### 2. Gender Detection Model
- The gender detection model classifies a person's gender as either male or female based on facial features.
- This model is built using a binary classification framework and utilizes pre-trained weights from a convolutional neural network (CNN).
- It is designed to handle diverse datasets, ensuring robust predictions across different ethnicities, lighting conditions, and face orientations.
- The model prioritizes fast inference speed, making it ideal for applications where low latency is critical.

## ⚙️ How the Models Differ

**Purpose:**
- The age detection model outputs a continuous numeric value (the predicted age), while the gender detection model provides a categorical label (male or female).

**Architectures:**
- The age detection model uses a regression-based neural network architecture, designed to predict numerical outputs.
- The gender detection model employs a classification-based architecture optimized for binary outcomes.

**Optimization and Challenges:**
- The age model faces challenges such as fine-tuning for age groups where features are less distinct (e.g., middle-aged individuals).
- The gender model is optimized to handle edge cases like ambiguous features, varying cultural representations, and occlusions (e.g., glasses or masks).

## 📂 Code Implementation

The system integrates **MediaPipe's face detection** as the foundation for identifying and extracting facial regions from input images or video streams.

Once the face is detected, the age and gender models process the cropped facial region:
1. **Preprocessing:** Resizes and normalizes the image for model compatibility.
2. **Model Inference:** The pre-trained models predict the age and gender from the processed image.
3. **Post-Processing:** Maps the predictions to human-readable outputs (e.g., age labels or gender categories).

The project includes **modular Python code**:
- `face_detection.py`: Handles real-time face detection using MediaPipe.
- `age_gender_models.py`: Loads pre-trained models for age and gender detection and performs predictions.
- `app.py`: Combines face detection with model inference for real-time webcam or video processing.
- `utils.py`: Contains helper functions for visualization and image handling.

## 📊 Performance and Accuracy

- The system achieves high accuracy for gender detection (~95% on testing datasets) and reliable age predictions with a margin of error of ±3 years on average.
- Both models are optimized for performance across CPUs and GPUs, ensuring compatibility with low-resource devices.
